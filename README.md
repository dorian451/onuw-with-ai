# One Night Ultimate Werewolf, with intelligent AI-powered agents

## Setup

This project uses [cargo-leptos](https://github.com/leptos-rs/cargo-leptos).

To run on localhost, run `cargo leptos watch`.

Alternatively, use `cargo leptos build` to build the site and server binary.
The site will be located in `target/site` and the binary in `target/<build mode>/onuw-with-ai` or `target/<build mode>/onuw-with-ai.exe`, depending on your platform.
When running the server binary, make sure the `site` folder is next to it.
